Project Name: Railway Crossing - Closed Gates Predicting

# Overview

This project is a mobile application for Android systems, developed in Kotlin, that provides users with valuable information and data. The application uses Selenium in Python for data retrieval from external sources, which is then stored in a database. Additionally, the project offers an alternative web interface accessible through web browsers for users who do not have an Android device.

# Features

**Mobile App (Android)**: The mobile app offers a user-friendly interface designed with Kotlin to provide seamless navigation and a smooth user experience. Users can access various data and information conveniently from their Android devices.
**Data Retrieval (Python + Selenium)**: The backend logic, implemented in Python with the Selenium library, facilitates the extraction of data from external sources. Selenium allows automated web scraping and data gathering, ensuring the most up-to-date information for the mobile app and web interface.
**Database Integration**: The collected data is stored securely in a database, ensuring efficient data management and quick retrieval. This database serves as a reliable repository for all essential information accessible to the mobile app and web interface.
**Web Interface**: For users without Android devices, the project provides a web interface accessible through standard web browsers. This alternative allows users to access the same data and information, ensuring platform compatibility.

# Setup and Installation

**Mobile App**: The Android application can be installed directly on Android devices by downloading it from the Google Play Store or by sideloading the APK file.
**Python Environment**: Set up a Python environment with the required dependencies, including Selenium and database connectors. Use virtual environments for a clean and isolated environment.
**Database Configuration**: Configure the database to store the collected data. Ensure the correct access credentials and permissions are in place for secure data storage and retrieval.
**Web Interface**: Deploy the web interface on a web server or hosting platform of choice, making it accessible to users via standard web browsers.

# Usage

**Mobile App**: Users can download the mobile app from the Google Play Store or install it via sideloading. Launch the app on an Android device, and it will provide a seamless experience to explore and access valuable data.
**Data Retrieval**: The Python script utilizing Selenium performs automated data retrieval. Ensure the script is executed at regular intervals to maintain updated data in the database.
**Web Interface**: Users can access the web interface using a web browser. The interface mirrors the functionality of the mobile app, providing a user-friendly experience for all users.
